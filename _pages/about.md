Hi! I am Kaloma Usman, a PhD scholar passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Precision Agriculture. My work focuses on developing intelligent systems that advance agricultural decision-making, automation, and data-driven insights.
I am also actively engaged in research exploring modern AI techniques and their real-world applications, particularly in solving challenges at the intersection of agriculture, environment, and emerging technologies. In addition to my academic work, I have experience in software engineering and applied AI development. You can read more about me [here]( /cv/)
